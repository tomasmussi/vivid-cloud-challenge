# Longest Palindromic Finder

This program finds which is the longest palindromic number between two bounds passed.
If it exists, it returns the longest palindromic number, otherwise it returns -1.


## Compiling
The project is built using Java 17 and maven
(which are not mandatory, though it uses JUnit 5 and Hamcrest which may not be available in previous versions of Java)

To compile, the `mvn compiler:compile` goal can be run and the Java classes generated.
A JAR file can be generated by running `mvn jar:jar`

It is suggested to run the `mvn package` command as it will compile the project, run all tests and package
the application JAR to be run.

## Running

After compiling, the application can be run by executing the JAR:
```bash
java -jar target/vivid-cloud-challenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 100 200
```
or running the project with the default parameters set in the pom.xml file.
```bash
 mvn exec:java
```
